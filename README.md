# Online Retail Sales Data Analysis and Price Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze sales data from an online retail company and develop predictive models to estimate unit prices of products sold in the United Kingdom market. It employs various data analysis and machine learning techniques to gain insights from the dataset and build accurate regression models for price prediction.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the "Online Retail" dataset, which contains transaction records for a UK-based online retail company between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011. The dataset includes information such as invoice numbers, stock codes, descriptions, quantities, unit prices, and customer IDs.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform in-depth analysis of the dataset, handling missing values, identifying outliers, and understanding variable relationships.
- Data Visualization: Create informative plots using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize patterns and trends in the data.
- Regression Modeling: Develop and evaluate multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression, to predict unit prices based on features like quantity, price range, and time of sale.
- Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared score.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Employ grid search with cross-validation to systematically tune the hyperparameters of regression models, optimizing their performance on the dataset.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have the required Python libraries installed.
3. Place the "OnlineRetail.csv" dataset in the same directory as the script.
4. Run the script to execute the EDA, data visualization, and modeling processes.
